This folder contains an example of an obfuscated class created by disassembling Unobfuscated.dll and modifying the IL to generate name clashes, similar to the behavior of tools such as Dotfuscator.

The project file has been modified to call ILAsm to build the DLL to be tested.

The relevant test is in Issue47_Obfuscation.cs

Unobfuscated.Class1 -> a
	int b() -> int a()
    int c(int x) -> int a(int x)
    class X -> class a
    int a -> int a

The original class was:

namespace Unobfuscated
{
    public class Class1
    {
        public int b()
        {
            return a;
        }
        public int c(int x)
        {
            return b();
        }
        public class X
		{
            public int x;
		}
        public int a;
    }
}

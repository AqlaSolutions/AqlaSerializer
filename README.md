AqlaSerializer
==============

<b>What is it?</b>

I'm reworking Protobuf-net to make a binary serializer with its own format which is dedicated to support all .NET specific features.

Also I'm planning to add object tree comparsion related features.

<b>What platforms are guaranteed? </b>

MS .NET 3.5+, Mono, Unity3D

<b>Will it be compatible with Protobuf-net? </b>

It will accept Protobuf-net attributes but it's binary format will not be compatible with Google Protocol Buffers.

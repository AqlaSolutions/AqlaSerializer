Before building replace Aqla.RunSharp project references with nuget dependencies 
or download RunSharp sources https://github.com/AqlaSolutions/runsharp and put them to ..\RunSharp\src.

You need to generate strong name keys before building. Please follow these instructions: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/assembly/create-public-private-key-pair

Generate runsharp_key.snk and put to ..\RunSharp\src\RunSharp.
Generate AqlaSerializer2Key.snk and put beside the sln file.

Open AqlaSerializer.sln in Visual Studio 2022 and install all prompted SDKs.

Some DTO and patform specific projects require additional SDKs but usually only building the main project aqlaserializer.csproj is necessary. Also some dto projects may find their dependencies only after running all tests in Debug and Release configurations. 

For Xamarin.Android run %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Android\android-sdk\SDK Manager.exe and install API 10 sdk (Android 2.3.3)

Some test projects may require ASP .NET MVC (1.0, 2,) 3:

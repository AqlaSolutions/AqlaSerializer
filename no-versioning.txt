instead of handling optional types where they are ignored... handle them on upper level by writing another fieldNumber! but doesn't work for ignored fields? ignored fields should only be used with stable wiretype 


overhead on each default/specified/nonull field - always written at least 1 byte

extensible works only after all normal fields

no-versioning for tuples and net object helpers

make test on same format
